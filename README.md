# Joe Mack's Public Speaking Github Repo

This is the single location for all of the presentations, code, etc., from my public speaking engagements over the years.

## Patience is a Virtue

If you are looking for something specific here...especially something the has happened in the distant past...I am creating the repository on September 17, 2018, specifically to publish the slides from my talk at Atlanta Code Camp 2018.

I will be moving over my past presentations at some point in the future...one at a time. I am adopting a naming convention for the folders that should allow easily finding talks that I have given over the years.

## Feedback

Comments should be enabled here in the repository, and you can always get in contact with me through my Github profile or social media (@mack24x7).
